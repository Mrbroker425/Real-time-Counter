# Real-time-Counter Project

This project implements a real-time character counter for a text area using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary purpose is to provide a live update on the number of characters entered in the text area, along with the remaining characters allowed.

## Languages Used

- **HTML**: 50.0%
- **CSS**: 29.9%
- **JavaScript**: 20.1%

## Usage

1. Add a text area to your HTML file with the id "text-area."
2. Include the JavaScript code provided in your project to enable real-time character counting.
3. The total character count and the remaining character count will be displayed dynamically as the user types.

## JavaScript Explanation

1. The JavaScript code begins by getting references to relevant HTML elements, such as the text area, total character display, and remaining character container.

2. An event listener is set up on the text area to detect keypresses.

3. The `updateCounter` function is called on each keypress, updating the displayed character counts.

4. The `updateCounter` function calculates and updates both the total character count and the remaining character count.

5. The total character count is displayed in an element with the id "Total-Characters."

6. The remaining character count is displayed in an element with the id "Remaining-container."

7. The `maxlength` attribute of the text area is used to determine the maximum allowed characters.

8. The remaining characters are calculated by subtracting the current character count from the maximum allowed characters.
